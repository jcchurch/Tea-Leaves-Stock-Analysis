This script is my tool for analyzing stocks on the stock market.

The main tools that I use for stock picking are:

- Yield
- Linear Transformation
- Beta

As this script grows, it might become necessary to split it
into more purposeful files. For now, a single script will do.

It requires the following libraries:

- urllib (standard)
- datetime (standard)
- bivariate (my own script, included)
- matplotlib (http://www.scipy.org/PyLab)

For now, just run the script and see the output.

python stocks.py

OUTPUT.

The graph produced by the program features a single 2D plot.

The x-axis is the current price represented by a linear transformation
score (i.e. how close it is to the 52-week high or 52-week low.)

The y-axis is the beta score (i.e. a linear regression slope formula of
the stock compared to the S&P 500.).

Each point is plotted with a blue "+" to represent that the stock is trading
higher after 52 weeks OR a red "+" to represent that the stock is trading
lower after 52 weeks (my dad thinks that this information is useful, I don't).

DISCLAIMER

I'm a regular investor. I don't advocate one holding over another with my
software. I try to let the data speak for itself. Having said that, stock
analysis is a bit like reading tea leaves: at the end of the day, you are
still guessing and taking risks. The purpose of this software is to point
you in the direction of good stock pick choices by which you should begin
your research.
